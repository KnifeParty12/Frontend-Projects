that should occur after you click the menu <b>i.e the dropdown effect and the text showing up in that manner</b> also I did'nt have Jquery installed back then so im using

animation. For instructions on how to download SASS here's a [link](https://medium.com/@raaechelb/sass-installing-on-netbeans-and-getting-started-2b5ce99d985c)
