<p> Created using HTML and CSS if you don't understand the text displayed on screen,you live one <b>sed life</b> xD

[5]. [Expanding ASS](https://github.com/KnifeParty12/Frontend-Projects/tree/master/Expanding%20ASS)
<p> An expanding menu icon with some <b>pretty deep stuff</b> You need to know some basic js to understand and apply the necessary actions
that should occur after you click the menu <b>i.e the dropdown effect and the text showing up in that manner</b> also I did'nt have Jquery installed back then so im using
a public library (URL in the code) still working on the contract button( I mean the cross that contracts the menu back Sigh! :( ) </p>

<p> <b>Requires SASS :( </b> It's a scale menu which translates in horizontal directon after click,the text inside elongates too providing a luicid flow to the
animation. For instructions on how to download SASS here's a [link](https://medium.com/@raaechelb/sass-installing-on-netbeans-and-getting-started-2b5ce99d985c)
